# Multimodal Agents Workshop Files

This workshop offers multiple learning approaches for building multimodal AI agents with MongoDB Atlas Vector Search and Google Gemini.

## ðŸ“š Available Files

### 1. `workshop_lab.ipynb` - Interactive Learning Version
**ðŸŽ¯ Recommended for workshops and self-learning**

- Contains TODO sections where you implement key components yourself
- Provides hints, documentation links, and code structure
- Includes validation to check your implementations
- Gradual difficulty progression from basic to advanced concepts

**Best for:** 
- Hands-on learning
- Workshop participants
- Understanding core concepts through implementation

### 2. `solutions.ipynb` - Complete Reference Implementation
**ðŸ“– Use as reference when stuck**

- Fully working implementation of all workshop components
- Identical to the enhanced version but renamed for clarity
- Can be run end-to-end without modifications
- Shows best practices and optimal implementations

**Best for:**
- Reference when stuck on TODOs
- Understanding complete implementations
- Comparing your solutions
- Quick demos

### 3. `solutions.py` - Code Snippets File
**ðŸ”§ Quick copy-paste solutions**

- Contains just the code snippets for each TODO section
- Organized by cell numbers and topics
- Easy to copy-paste specific solutions
- Includes complete function examples

**Best for:**
- Quick reference
- Copy-pasting specific solutions
- IDE-based development

## ðŸš€ Recommended Learning Path

1. **Start with `workshop_lab.ipynb`**
   - Try implementing each TODO section yourself
   - Use the hints and documentation links provided
   - Don't look at solutions immediately!

2. **When stuck, check `solutions.py`**
   - Find the relevant solution snippet
   - Compare with your implementation
   - Understand the differences

3. **For complete context, reference `solutions.ipynb`**
   - See how the solution fits in the complete workflow
   - Understand the broader context
   - Validate your approach

## ðŸŽ¯ Workshop Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to:

- âœ… Process PDFs and extract images using PyMuPDF
- âœ… Create and manage MongoDB Atlas vector search indexes
- âœ… Implement multimodal embeddings with Voyage AI
- âœ… Build AI agents with function calling using Google Gemini
- âœ… Add conversational memory with session management
- âœ… Create ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) agent architectures

## ðŸ”§ Key TODO Sections

The workshop includes hands-on implementation of:

1. **PDF Processing** - Load PDFs from streams and extract pages as images
2. **Data Ingestion** - Insert documents into MongoDB collections
3. **Vector Search** - Create vector indexes and implement search pipelines
4. **Function Calling** - Define tool declarations for Gemini integration
5. **Agent Logic** - Implement tool selection and response generation
6. **Memory System** - Build conversational memory with MongoDB
7. **ReAct Pattern** - Create reasoning and acting agent loops

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Success

- **Read the hints carefully** - They contain important implementation details
- **Check the documentation links** - Official docs provide comprehensive examples
- **Test incrementally** - Run cells as you complete each TODO
- **Use the validation** - Built-in checks help verify correctness
- **Don't skip steps** - Each section builds on previous implementations

## ðŸ†˜ Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the error messages carefully
2. Review the hints and documentation links
3. Look at the corresponding solution in `solutions.py`
4. Compare with the complete implementation in `solutions.ipynb`
5. Ensure all previous TODO sections are completed correctly

Happy coding! ðŸš€
